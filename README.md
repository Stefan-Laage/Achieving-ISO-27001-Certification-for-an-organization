# Achieving ISO 27001 certification for an organization

# Executive Summary
This repository supports an assessment of the organization’s alignment with **ISO/IEC 27001**.  
It evaluates both **mandatory ISMS requirements** and **risk-based security controls**, providing a foundation for certification readiness and ongoing information security governance.

---

## Assessment Scope
The assessment is structured into two core components:

### 1. Mandatory ISO 27001 Clauses (Clauses 4–10)
These clauses define how the Information Security Management System (ISMS) is established, governed, and continuously improved.  
They are **mandatory for all ISO 27001-certified organizations**.

Key focus areas:
- Organizational context and interested parties
- Leadership accountability and information security policy
- Risk assessment and risk treatment planning
- Resource management, competence, and awareness
- Operational planning and control
- Performance evaluation and internal audit
- Nonconformity handling and continual improvement

**Outcome:**  
Validates the presence of required governance structures, management processes, and oversight mechanisms needed to operate an effective ISMS.

---

### 2. Annex A Security Controls
Annex A contains the security controls selected based on organizational risk.

For each control, the assessment documents:
- Control identifier and description
- Applicability decision (**in scope / out of scope**)
- Business and risk-based justification

**Outcome:**  
Serves as the basis for the **Statement of Applicability (SoA)**, demonstrating that control selection and exclusions are deliberate, risk-driven, and defensible.

---

## Key Deliverables
This assessment supports:
- ISO/IEC 27001 gap analysis
- Statement of Applicability (SoA)
- Traceability between risks, controls, and exclusions
- Audit-ready documentation for internal and external reviews

---

## Executive Value
From a leadership perspective, this assessment:
- Provides visibility into information security maturity
- Clarifies accountability and decision rationale
- Reduces audit risk through structured documentation
- Enables prioritization of remediation and improvement activities

---

## Conclusion
This assessment framework aligns fully with ISO/IEC 27001 requirements and provides a solid foundation for certification readiness, risk-based decision-making, and continuous improvement of the ISMS.
